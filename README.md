# Master's Thesis

We present an analysis of the impact of neural-based domain adaptation in~astronomical spectroscopy.
Domain adaptation addresses the~problem of~applying prior knowledge to a new data of interest.
Therefore, we selected a~problem~of quasar identification in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey using labelled data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
We choose to experiment with four neural models for domain adaptation:
Deep Domain Confusion, Deep Correlation Alignment, Domain-Adversarial Network and Deep Reconstruction-Classification Network.
However, our experiments reveal that these model cannot improve classification performance in comparison to a convolutional neural network that does not consider domain adaptation.
Using dimensionality reduction, statistics of~the~selected methods and misclassifications,
we show that the domain adaptation methods are not robust enough to be applied to the complex and dirty astronomical data.
