# Assignment

Let's brainstorm the assignment here. It should be some base research with
application in astronomy because my supervisor will be Petr Škoda.

Zeroth idea is *meta learning* which I am currently most excited about
but I need to do a lot of reading to get know what is possible to do
and what are the applications.

First idea is *transfer learning* which is for sure interesting research
area but I think very hard and not that popular.
For application in astronomy see my bachelor's thesis.

Second idea is *reinforcement learning* that would be very nice as it is
an exciting area of research but the application to astronomy is not obvious
now to me. Maybe interactive learning where human select what he want to find
is large data and the network is learning what she or he want to find.

Third idea is *unsupervised learning* that is very needed area of research
and very hard. The applications are obvious as there is many unlabeled data
in astronomy.

Fourth idea is *natural language processing* which seems unsuitable for
astronomy.

Fifth idea is *generative adversarial networks*. For example synthetic data
generation or it might be possibly used for transfer learning
(domain adaptation). Next option is noise reduction and data reparation.
Synthetic data generation would enable to learning very deep networks.
But how to train general adversarial network with such big data beforehand.

Sixth idea is *recurrent neural networks* to predict some event. For example
explosion of a stellar object from photometry.
