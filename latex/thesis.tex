\chapter{Introduction}

How to use \textit{neural network based domain adaptation} to extract knowledge from the source domain of \textit{astronomical spectral data}
and apply it to the target \textit{astronomical spectral data}?

In this work, we would like to prove that astronomical spectroscopy can benefit from domain adapatation (DA).
Previous research has shown that DA can overcome the problem of analysis data from different distribution in one experiment.
In the first chapter~\ref{da_chapter}, we provide a summary of theory of DA, neural networks in DA and DA in astronomy.
Then, in chapter~\ref{data_chapter}, we describe current spectroscopic sky surveys
which might be source of suitable astronomical spectral data.
In experiments~\ref{exp_chapter}, we try to show the benefits of neural DA in astronomy.
Consider that our work is limited to astronomical spectroscopy and neural models.
Having said that, we will apply these methods\dots{}

\section{Problem Definition and Motivation}

The goal of this thesis is the analysis of the impact of domain adaptation in astronomical archives with a focus on neural networks
that would allow using labelled data from one ground-based telescope or space mission archive to discover knowledge in another archive.
Current astronomy has been the primary customer of scalable Big data handling and analysis requirements due to its petabyte-scale archives,
where an advanced machine learning is an indispensable part of workflows leading to new discoveries.

\chapter{Domain Adaptation (DA)}
\label{da_chapter}

Survey the current state of domain adaptation using neural network models in machine learning and with a focus on astronomical applications.

\section{DA in Context of Machine and Transfer Learning}

Now, we introduce the crucial concept of our work: \textit{domain adaptation}.
Domain adaptation is \textit{a subfield of transfer learning},
which is part of machine learning.
Transfer learning is defined in most papers regarding the survey by Pan and Yang~\cite{pan2010}.
A more recent survey by Weiss, Khoshgoftaar and Wang~\cite{weiss2016} has the benefit
that it contains newer methods than the survey by Pan and Yang~\cite{pan2010},
but its definition of transfer learning and domain adaptation is the same.

Machine learning has a common assumption that training and test data are \textit{independent and identically distributed}
that means samples are drawn from the same feature space and the same distribution.~\cite{daume2006}
When this assumption does not hold transfer learning and domain adaptation come into play.
Moreover, there is a biological inspiration
because humans seem to have natural ways to transfer knowledge from previous experience to new challenges.~\cite{torrey2010}

Pan and Yang define transfer learning as the ability of a system to recognise and apply knowledge and skill learned in previous tasks to novel tasks
and they introduce the notion of \textit{a domain} and \textit{a task}.
A domain consists of two components: \textit{a feature space} and \textit{a marginal probability distribution}.
Given a specific domain, a task consists of two components: \textit{a label space} and \textit{an objective predictive function}
which is not observed but learned from training data.
When we are given a transfer learning problem,
we have to identify \textit{a source domain} and \textit{a source learning task},
\textit{a target domain} and \textit{a target learning task}.
Then, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function in the target domain using knowledge in the source domain and the source task,
where the domains are different or the tasks are different.~\cite{pan2010}

Lastly, Torrey and Shavlik warn that both the source and target domains and tasks need to be sufficiently related
else negative transfer may occur.
Negative transfer is the situation in which the usage of source data degrades the performance.
On the other side, when the performance is improved,
we talk about a positive transfer.~\cite{torrey2010}

\section{Theory and Formalization of DA}

Domain adaptation is the scenario when the source and target domains have different marginal probability distributions
(for example two different telescopes observed the spectra)
while the tasks are the same
(we would like to classify them into the same classes).
