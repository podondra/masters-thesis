\chapter{Introduction}

How to use neural network based domain adaptation to extract knowledge from the source domain of astronomical spectral data
and apply it to the target astronomical spectral data?

In this work, we would like to prove that astronomical spectroscopy can benefit from domain adapatation (DA).
Previous research has shown that DA can overcome the problem of analysis data from different distribution in one experiment.
In the first chapter~\ref{da_chapter}, we provide a summary of theory of DA, neural networks in DA and DA in astronomy.
Then, in chapter~\ref{data_chapter}, we describe current spectroscopic sky surveys
which might be source of suitable astronomical spectral data.
In experiments~\ref{exp_chapter}, we try to show the benefits of neural DA in astronomy.
Consider that our work is limited to astronomical spectroscopy and neural models.
Having said that, we will apply these methods\dots{}

\section{Problem Definition and Motivation}

The goal of this thesis is the analysis of the impact of domain adaptation in astronomical archives with a focus on neural networks
that would allow using labelled data from one ground-based telescope or space mission archive to discover knowledge in another archive.
Current astronomy has been the primary customer of scalable Big data handling and analysis requirements due to its petabyte-scale archives,
where an advanced machine learning is an indispensable part of workflows leading to new discoveries.
