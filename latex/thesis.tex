\chapter{Introduction}

The thesis we put forward ask the question of what is the impact of domain adaptation based on neural networks in astronomical spectroscopy.
Having two different spectroscopic sky surveys are we able to extract knowledge from one and apply it to another with a neural network.
To be concrete, we will experiment with the identification of quasars in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey with quasars identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

Previous research in machine learning has shown
that domain adaptation can overcome the problem of analysing data from different distributions in one experiment
while having a sufficient amount of data.
Nowadays, astronomy is facing an avalanche of data,
and exponential growth of data transforms science in general.
The vast data sources provide immense potential for discoveries.
However, we need to adapt existing methods or develop new sophisticated automatic approaches for data analysis.
Therefore, we see potential in domain adaptation by exploiting knowledge extracted in previous problems.

To explore the potential of domain adaptation based on neural networks,
we set the goal of this thesis to be the analysis of the impact of domain adaptation
using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for identification of quasars in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey.

Therefore, in the next chapter~\ref{data_chapter},
we firstly describe the two spectroscopic surveys,
and we demonstrate why they are suitable for or problem.
Then, in chapter~\ref{da_chapter},
we provide a summary of the theory of domain adaptation in the context of the machine and transfer learning,
survey domain adaptation based on neural network
and give an overview of applications of domain adaptation in astronomy.
In the chapter with experiments~\ref{exp_chapter},
we analyse the impact of domain adaptation with four models based on neural networks.
We suggest future improvements and conclude this thesis in the last chapter~\ref{conclusion}.
