\section{DA in Context of Machine and Transfer Learning}

Now, we introduce the crucial concept of our work: domain adaptation.
Domain adaptation is a subfield of transfer learning,
which is part of machine learning.
Transfer learning is defined in most papers regarding the survey by Pan and Yang~\cite{pan2010}.
A more recent survey by Weiss, Khoshgoftaar and Wang~\cite{weiss2016} has the benefit
that it contains newer methods than the survey by Pan and Yang~\cite{pan2010},
but its definition of transfer learning and domain adaptation is the same.

Machine learning has a common assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed
that means samples are drawn from the same feature space and the same distribution.~\cite{daume2006}
When this assumption does not hold transfer learning and domain adaptation come into play.
Moreover, there is a biological inspiration
because humans seem to have natural ways to transfer knowledge from previous experience to new challenges.~\cite{torrey2010}

% TODO define TL
Pan and Yang~\cite{pan2010} define transfer learning
as the ability of a system to recognise and apply knowledge and skill
learned in previous tasks to novel tasks
and they introduce the notion of a domain and a task.

A domain consists of two components: a feature space and a marginal probability distribution.

\begin{definition}
	A domain \(\mathcal{D} = [\mathcal{X}, P(\mathbf{X})]\)
	is a~\(d\)-dimensional feature space \(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d\)
	with a~marginal provavility distribution \(P(\mathbf{X})\).~\cite{pan2010}
\end{definition}

Given a specific domain, a task consists of two components: a label space and an objective predictive function
which is not observed but learned from training data.

\begin{definition}
	A task \(\mathcal{T} = [\mathcal{Y}, P(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X})]\)
	is a label space \(\mathcal{Y}\)
	and a conditional probability distribution \(P(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X})\).~\cite{pan2010}
\end{definition}

When we are given a transfer learning problem,
we have to identify a source domain and a source learning task,
a target domain and a target learning task.
Then, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function in the target domain using knowledge in the source domain and the source task,
where the domains are different or the tasks are different.~\cite{pan2010}

Lastly, Torrey and Shavlik warn that both the source and target domains and tasks need to be sufficiently related
else negative transfer may occur.
Negative transfer is the situation in which the usage of source data degrades the performance.
On the other side, when the performance is improved,
we talk about a positive transfer.~\cite{torrey2010}

TL helps to exploit data or models available in similar domains.~\cite{csurka2017}

\section{Theory and Formalization of DA}

% TODO define DA
Domain adaptation (DA) is a particular case of TL
that leverages labelled data from source domain to learn a classifier for a target domain while the tasks are the same.
It is assumed that source and target domains are not identical but related.
If they were identical it would be a standard machine learning problem.
Therefore there is a distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains (\textit{domain shift}).~\cite{csurka2017}

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Domain adapatiton} is the scenario when the source
	\(\mathcal{D}^s = [\mathcal{X}^s, P(\mathbf{X}^s)]\)
	and target \(\mathcal{D}^t = [\mathcal{X}^t, P(\mathbf{X}^t)]\)
	are different (\(\mathcal{D}^s \ne \mathcal{D}^t\))
	but the source \(\mathcal{T}^s\) and target \(\mathcal{T}^t\)
	tasks are the same (\(\mathcal{T}^s = \mathcal{T}^t\)).
	% TODO should be the second condition always true for DA
	The first condition implies \(\mathcal{X}^s \ne \mathcal{X}^t\),
	\(P(\mathbf{X}^s) \ne P(\mathbf{X}^t)\) or both are true.~\cite{pan2010}
\end{definition}

% TODO refer to specific section
In our case, the two archive have different target selection strategies
and the instrument are different.

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Homogeneous} DA is setting in which the source \(\mathcal{X}^s\)
	and target \(\mathcal{X}^t\) feature spaces are the same
	(\(\mathcal{X}^s = \mathcal{X}^t\))
	while in \textit{heterogeneous} the source and target spaces are different
	(\(\mathcal{X}^s \ne \mathcal{X}^t\)).~\cite{csurka2017}
\end{definition}

% TODO check feature space
Our case is the \textit{homogeneous} DA where the feature spaces are identical
(\(\mathcal{X}^s = \mathcal{X}^t\))
still the source and target data are have different distributions
(\(P(\mathbf{X}^s) \ne P(\mathbf{X}^t)\)).
Therefore, further we focus on homogeneous DA.
because our spectra prepared into a same feature space (\(\mathbb{R}^{3659}\)).

Next we distinguish \textit{supervised}, \textit{semi-supervised}
and \textit{unsupervised} DA
according to availability of labels in the target domain:

\begin{itemize}
	\item superivesed DA: labelled data in the target domain are present;
	\item semi-supervised DA: we have only very limited amount of labelled data in the target domain while most of the data is unlabelled;
	\item unsupervised DA: no labelled data are available in the target domain.
\end{itemize}

We are concern with \textit{unsupervised DA} because we have
no labelled data in the target domain.~\cite{wang2018}

Nowadays, methods of DA are generally distinguished into to categories:
\textit{shallow DA} methods that can be applied on extracted vectors of features
and \textit{deep DA} methods based on neural networks and deep learning
augemented for domain adapation.~\cite{csurka2017}

According to Wang and Deng~\cite{wang2018} shallow DA methods
can be categorised into two classes:
\textit{instance-based DA}
(the discrepancy is reduces by reweighting the source instances)
and \textit{feature-based DA}
(tries to learn a common shared space in which the discrepancy diminishes).
However, shallow DA methods are not interesting for us
because they do not utilize neural network.
Still one possibility is to use a neural network as a feature extractor.~\cite{csurka2017}

The following section introduces the other category of deep DA
which takes the advantage of neural networks.

\section{Neural Networks in DA}

Donahue et al. showed in the paper on DeCAF~\cite{donahue2014}
that deep neural networks learn more transferable features
but the performance is still affected by the domain shift.

% TODO write about DeCAF

The group of DA methods using neural networks is called \textit{deep DA}
and Wang \& Deng define it in~\cite{wang2018}:

% TODO broad and narrow sense
\begin{definition}
	Deep DA is a method that utilizes a deep network to enhance the performance of DA.
\end{definition}

Approaches to deep DA were originally divided by Csurka in~\cite{csurka2017}
into three categories according to training loss.
Then, Wang and Deng further improve and detail the categorisation in~\cite{wang2018}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{discrepancy-based} DA fine-tunes the neural network
		with target data to diminish the domain shift;
	\item \textit{adversarial-based} DA encorage domain confusion
		by using discriminators with adversarial objective; and
	\item \textit{reconstruction-based} DA uses data reconstruction auxialiary task to learn domain invariant features.
\end{itemize}

We summarize the deep DA methods categorisation in the mind map of Figure~\ref{mind_map}.

			};

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discrepancy-based DA}

Discrepancy-based deep DA uses either labelled or unlabelled target data
to fine-tune a neural network to diminish the dicrepancy
between the source and target domains.

The discrepancy-based method divided based on
\textit{class}, \textit{statistic}, \textit{architecture} and \textit{geometric}
criterion by~\cite{wang2018}.

DDC~\cite{tzeng2014}, DAN~\cite{long2015}, JAN~\cite{long2017}
and Deep CORAL~\cite{sun2016}.

\subsection{Adversarial-based DA}

Adversarial-based deep DA utilizes a domain discriminator
that tries to distinguish whether a sample comes from source and target domains.
If we are able to confuse the discriminator
we will also achieve domain confusion through the adversarial objective.

The methods are divided into \textit{generative} and \textit{non-generative}
models by~\cite{wang2018}

DANN~\cite{ganin2016} and ADDA~\cite{tzeng2017}.

\subsection{Reconstruction-based DA}

The last group of methods is based on data reconstruction auxialiary task.
The reconstructor forces to find a shared representation
of a source and target domains.

According to~\cite{wang2018} subgroups are \textit{encoder-decoder} and
\textit{adversarial} reconstruction.

SDA~\cite{vincent2008, glorot2011}, mSDA~\cite{chen2012}, DRCN~\cite{ghifary2016} and DSN~\cite{bousmalis2016}.

\section{Previous Applications of DA in Astronomy}

% TODO something like: so far shallow but some deep DA not sufficient

As we have shown, domain adaptation is of great interest to astronomers
because of different instruments, measurements and observation distribution.
Therefore, we survey the current state of domain adaptation in astronomical applications in this section.

If we have a common set of observed stars in both archives,
then we can map them and learn a transfer function.
Ho et al.~\cite{ho2017} did exactly that
% TODO add APOGEE to acronyms
because they found a common set of 9\,952 spectra in both APOGEE and LAMOST archive.
Using that set, they trained the Cannon method~\cite{ness2015},
and they used the model to transfer some physical parameters from APOGEE to LAMOST.

In the case, when there is no common set Gupta et al. experimented with subspace alignment~\cite{fernando2014} and kernel mean matching~\cite{gretton2009} followed by active learning.~\cite{gupta2016}
In the case of subspace alignment, the negative transfer occurred while the kernel mean matching seems very promising in the task of supernova classification.
Then, Vilalta et al.~\cite{vilalta2018} extended the work of Gupta et al.~\cite{gupta2016}.
Vilalta et al. used a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to learn a prior on the model parameters from a spectroscopic source domain
and then use this prior distribution to learn a model in a photometric target domain.
Concretely, Vilalta et al. put a prior on the number of layers of a neural network
and then used active learning.
Richards et al.~\cite{richards2011} faced a similar situation, as Gupta et al.
Richards et al. introduce the problem as sample selection bias~\cite{shimodaira2000} or covariate shift~\cite{heckman1979}
when different distributions generate the source and target data.
That is precisely the problem we have defined as domain adaptation.
Richards et al. experimented with random forest in combination with three domain adaptation methods:
importance weighting~\cite{shimodaira2000}, co-training~\cite{blum1998} and active learning~\cite{settles2009}.
The result is not surprising from our point of view.
Active learning works best while importance weighting and co-training achieve negative transfer.

The term transfer learning has been recently used in the context of deep learning.
However, transfer learning in the context of deep learning means something more concrete than what we defined as transfer learning previously.
Transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the specific situation
when a pretrained deep neural network model is taken,
and its last layers are retrained with the target domain data.
Ackermann et al.~\cite{ackermann2018} employed with the transfer learning approach in the context of deep learning to detect galaxy merges.
Ackermann et al. took the Xception convolutional neural network~\cite{chollet2017}
and retrain its last layers with images of galaxy merger labelled in a citizen science Galaxy Zoo project.
This transfer learning approach allowed Ackermann et al. to lower the best error rate so far by 15\%.
