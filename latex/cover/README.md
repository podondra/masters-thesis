# Short HOWTO for Template of Theses' Cover

In order to keep the design of all submitted theses similar-looking, proposed
layout must be followed, including all the information. This is ensured when
binding is done at this company: Powerprint, Zikova 19. Binding may be done
at any other business. In that case, the correct look of the cover is in your
responsibility. Note these possible issues:

All the proposed information must be included in correct order and letter case:

1. NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY AND FACULTY,
2. CTU logo,
3. thesis' title,
4. THESIS' TYPE,
5. year & first name and SURNAME incl. academic degrees;

- font, especially metrics (size, width),
- exact layout.

Shelf back should include information in the following format:

year (left)	TYPE OF THESIS (centre)	Name and SURNAME (right)

Use this template with LATEX 2e (TeXLive 2010 recommended).
