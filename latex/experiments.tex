\chapter{Experiments: Application of Neural DA to Spectral Data}
\label{exp_chapter}

\section{Data Preparation}

There is a bug in the SDSS DR14Q catalog as some QSO cannot be identified.
Therefore the labels are incomplete and there will be spectra truly QSO
but not identified in our dataset
acting againt our objective during learning.
We hope to find a robust solution.

Moreover, evaluation on LAMOST data can be biased
because the QSO identification strategy is different in LAMOST and SDSS.
Therefore, some QSO might not be identified in LAMOST.

Analysis of wavelength range.

Sizes of source and target datasets: number of QSOs.
